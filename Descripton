# Case Study - Banking Domain

Business/Domain Understanding
Context
Financial markets are fundamental institutions in any developing economy. They play a crucial role in promoting economic growth by facilitating the channeling of saving decisions into productive investment. A major concern for financial institutions is credit risk, because if not managed properly, it can lead to a banking collapse. 

In our banking system, banks have many products to sell but the main source of income of any bank is on its credit line. Loan is the core business part of banks. A bank's profit or a loss depends to a large extent on loans i.e. whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting. 

Though a lot of people are applying for loans. However, they may have some difficulty in repaying the loan, due to their own capability to repay loan, their personal monetary terms, etc.. It’s hard to select the genuine applicant, who will repay the loan. While doing the process manually, a lot of misconception may happen to select the genuine applicant. The banks hold the risk of losing the amount loaned to the borrowers, which is basically regarded as "Credit risk". 

Credit risk is the potential that a bank’s borrower or counterparty fails to meet its obligations in repaying the loan borrowed from the financial institutions ("banks").

By predicting the loan defaulters, the bank can reduce its Non-Performing Assets. This makes the study of this phenomenon very important. 

Thus, the banks need to manage the credit risks in their portfolio both at the individual borrower and transactional level, as well as to consider the linkage between credit risks and other types of risk. This is because these are criteria to assess the success/failure of any banking lending activities.

Many research confirmed that machine learning technology is highly efficient to predict this situation. This technique is applied through learning from previous data.


What is Credit Risk?
Credit risk refers to the likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet their obligations in repaying a debt. In other words, it's the risk that a borrower might default on a loan or be unable to meet their contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss for the lender.
Managing and assessing credit risk is a crucial aspect of financial management for both lenders and borrowers. Lenders employ various tools and models, like credit scoring systems, to evaluate and mitigate credit risk. Borrowers, on the other hand, seek to maintain good creditworthiness to secure favorable lending terms and opportunities.

SPRINT 1 - EDA
Task - Exploratory Data Analysis

Assume that you are working as a Data Scientist with one of the world's leading financial institutions (like HSBC).

This is an open ended question. Kindly apply all your knowledge to perform an exploratory data analysis on the given dataset. It is known that the target variable is Loan Status.

However, you are mandatorily supposed to solve the below mentioned EDA Task for your presentation:
Explore the data distribution of each column.
Identify some important patterns i.e. Which variables are most significant with respect to the target variable?
Insights and Recommendations (i.e. Data Driven Business Decision)
Write proper conclusions and provide recommendations to the bank based on the insights.
SPRINT 2 - Build a Data App

Background:
Your manager has tasked you with building a Data Dashboard using Streamlit. A Data Dashboard is a dynamic way to present data insights, which is widely used in the industry. It allows for interactive exploration of the data for end-users. Unlike a static PowerPoint presentation, you'll be providing a fully functional, user-friendly dashboard to share with the client.

Why a Data Dashboard?
Dynamic Insights: Instead of static visuals, a dashboard offers real-time data exploration.
Interactivity: End-users can interact with the data, making it more engaging and insightful.
Professional Presentation: It's a modern, professional way to showcase data insights.

Why Streamlit?
User-Friendly: Streamlit is known for its simplicity, making it accessible even for those new to data science.
Rapid Prototyping: It allows for quick development of interactive web applications.
Integration with Data Tools: Streamlit easily integrates with popular data libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

Benefits for You:
You'll gain experience in building dynamic data applications.
You'll be able to present data insights in a way that's more engaging and impactful than static presentations.

Task: You'll be providing a fully functional, interactive Data Dashboard built using Streamlit, offering a modern and engaging way to present data insights to the client.


SPRINT 3 - Model Building

Task - Data Preparation and Model Building (Credit Risk Scoring)

Problem Statement - Given various features about a customer like Age, Income, Loan Amount, Loan Intent, Home Ownership etc.. , predict if in case the loan is given, will the customer default or not on the Loan payments.

Why predict Credit Risk? (Business Impact)
Credit risk scoring, also known as credit scoring, is a statistical method used by financial institutions to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses applying for credit. It is a way to assess the likelihood that a borrower will default on their financial obligations, such as repaying a loan or credit card debt.
Defaulting customers not only pose financial risks but also impact customer satisfaction. Moreover lengthy loan approval processes can lead to customer dissatisfaction and impact the bank's ability to attract and retain customers. Machine learning models can automate and expedite the loan approval process by providing quick and accurate risk assessments, leading to faster decision-making.


Task - Prepare the data and build a model to predict if a customer is going to default or not.

Step - 1: Load the data
Step - 2: Document the below mentioned points properly: 
- Identify the input and output/target variables. 
- Identify the type of ML Task.
- Identify the Evaluation Metric.
	- For regression task - Mean Absolute Error
	- For classification task - Accuracy
Step - 3: Split the dataset into Training and Testing (recommended 75:25 split).
Step - 4: Data preparation on train data:
- For Numerical Variables - Standardization or Normalization (Fit and Transform)
- For Categorical - LabelEncoding or OneHotEncoding (Choose wisely)
Step - 5: Data preparation on test data:
- For Numerical Variables - Standardization (Transform)
- For Categorical - LabelEncoding or OneHotEncoding (Choose wisely)
Step - 6: Model Training Phase - Use all the algorithms mentioned below to train separate models:
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
Step - 7: Predict and evaluate each model separately using the correct evaluation metric. Use metrics.accuracy_score(actual, predict).
Step - 8: Display a plot which shows all the algorithms applied along with the accuracies achieved. Write your conclusion on the best algorithm for Credit Risk Scoring.
